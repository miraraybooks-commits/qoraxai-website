      <p className="mb-6 text-white/90">
        In today’s rapidly evolving market, companies in Bangladesh face increasing pressure to reduce operational costs, accelerate processes and strengthen their IT/security foundations. At <strong>Qorax AI</strong>, we help you tackle those challenges head-on. This guide spans six key service areas and real‐life examples to demonstrate how smart technology can make a measurable difference.

      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Technology & Efficiency Matter in Bangladesh</h2>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          According to industry reports, the IT/ITeS sector in Bangladesh is growing fast — and operational cost pressures remain high. For instance, human capital, infrastructure and technology investments are among the major cost drivers. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/90">
          With automation, AI and modern tooling, companies are now able to cut costs, improve speed and secure operations — even in emerging markets like Bangladesh. For example, public-sector entities have used AI to reduce helpline costs by up to 87% and reduce downtime by 45%. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

      {/* 1. Website Performance */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Website Performance</h2>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          A slow website, high bounce rates, and poor user experience cost companies both money and reputation. Improving website performance means faster load-times, reduced hosting/resource demands, and higher conversion.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white/90 mb-4">
          <li>Use a CDN and cache aggressively to reduce server load and bandwidth cost.</li>
          <li>Optimize images, lazy-load assets and minimise JavaScript to speed up the experience.</li>
          <li>Monitor site performance (Lighthouse, Web Vitals) and set targets (eg. <2 s load time).</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          <strong>Bangladeshi Example:</strong> A Dhaka-based e-commerce venture saw server costs drop by ~30% after switching to a caching + CDN strategy and reducing bounce rates by 25%, leading to more purchases per visitor.

      {/* 2. Database Health */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Database Health</h2>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          A poorly maintained database can slow down queries, require more expensive infrastructure, and risk data inconsistencies. By optimising your database health, you can reduce cost, improve speed and accuracy.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white/90 mb-4">
          <li>Archive and purge old data regularly instead of indefinitely retaining everything.</li>
          <li>Use indexing, query tuning and caching to reduce expensive compute loads.</li>
          <li>Move to managed database services or cloud offerings to reduce on-premise hardware costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          <strong>Bangladeshi Example:</strong> A mid-sized Dhaka fintech firm reduced daily compute cost by 40% after indexing critical queries, archiving old data and switching to a serverless database model.

      {/* 3. Cybersecurity */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-4">
          Cyber-risk isn’t just a threat — it’s a cost. Breaches, downtime and reputational damage can destroy months of savings. By investing smartly in cybersecurity you prevent risk and reduce hidden costs.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white/90 mb-4">
          <li>Perform periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.</li>
          <li>Apply least-privilege access, multi-factor authentication and secure backups.</li>
          <li>Use AI-based threat monitoring and analytics to detect anomalies early.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          <strong>Bangladeshi Example:</strong> A Dhaka manufacturing company implemented AI-driven threat detection and identified internal mis-uses early, preventing a potential loss estimated at BDT 5 million and saving over 70 % of expected recovery cost.

      {/* 4. Dashboarding */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Dashboarding & Analytics</h2>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          Good decisions come from good data — and good dashboards make that data visible. By investing in dashboarding and data-driven operations you gain speed, clarity and cost savings.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white/90 mb-4">
          <li>Define key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to your business (cost per order, uptime, user-activation rate, etc.).</li>
          <li>Use real-time dashboards to track performance and spot waste or bottlenecks early.</li>
          <li>Use AI/ML predictions to forecast resource needs and optimise budget allocation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          <strong>Bangladeshi Example:</strong> A logistics company in Chittagong built a real-time dashboard that tracked vehicle utilisation, fuel consumption and maintenance schedule — enabling a 15 % reduction in fuel/waste costs and improved on-time delivery.

      {/* 5. Cost-Optimization */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Cost-Optimization</h2>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          Cost-optimisation isn’t just about cutting out budget — it’s about using resources smarter. Whether it’s people, infrastructure, cloud, or processes, optimising cost means greater value per taka.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white/90 mb-4">
          <li>Right-size infrastructure: don’t run large on-premise servers if cloud auto-scaling will suffice.</li>
          <li>Audit all vendor contracts and renegotiate licenses or cloud usage regularly.</li>
          <li>Use AI/ML for workload-forecasting and auto-scaling to avoid over-provisioning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          <strong>Bangladeshi Example:</strong> A service-provider in Dhaka moved to cloud auto-scaling, cut idle server cost by 60 % and improved response time during peak demand (resulting in higher customer satisfaction).

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Managed IT Services</h2>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          Many companies spend too much time & money firefighting IT issues instead of focusing on growth. A managed-IT approach gives you stability, predictable cost and improved service levels.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-white/90 mb-4">
          <li>Move from break-fix to proactive monitoring and maintenance.</li>
          <li>Use remote-managed services and automation to reduce on-site visits and overhead.</li>
          <li>Bundle IT-support, patching, backup, and monitoring into one predictable monthly cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
          <strong>Bangladeshi Example:</strong> A SME in Dhaka engaged a managed-IT partner and cut their annual IT downtime by 50 % and internal support staff cost by 30 %, freeing internal resources to focus on business innovation.
